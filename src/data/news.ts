      name: "Cultivating of New Sort of Organic Potato Seeds for Producing Chips",
      description: `Mountain Food Products, LLC (MFP), a Tajik company
      incorporated in July of 2013, is a for – profit social
      enterprise, with a mission to benefit local economies,
      alleviate poverty and create sustainable local
      employment.
     The LLC MFP has been granted subsidy for renting one
      hectare of land to cultivate raw potato for processing. The
      idea behind the project was to encourage farmers to
      invest in potato farming to enhance rural development
      and thus improving their living standards.
     The main outcomes of the project are the following:
     Creation of additional four job places.
     Around twenty-five people benefited from the project indirectly as suppliers, service providers.
     The income of the company increased in 65%
     The lesson learnt will be replicated in Shugnan in 2021 and continued in Ishkashim district.
     The MFP “Mountain Foods” expected to yield 40 tons of potatoes, however due to unfavourable weather and COVID-19 consequences could harvest only 25 tons. The results brought the following conclusions:
     Continue to maintain contact between farmers and provide the same variety of seeds
     Regularly follow-up the signed contracts between the farmers and LLC “Mountain Food Product”.
     Conduct monitoring of the same one-hectare of land and provide consultations and services to the farmers in Shugnan in addition to Ishkashim district.`,
